        <p>The data on this website is from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). It is the department of the government of New York City responsible for public health. Their website includes a variety of resources, including information on how to find child care, emergency preparedness, and health insurance. They also provide essential health services, promote public health iniatives, prevent the spread of disease, and also investigate suspicious clusters of illness. It was formed on April 5th, 1870 and still has jurisdiction in NYC today. It now has a budget of $1.6 billion and more than 7,000 employees throughout the five boroughs, as well as being one of the largest public health agencies in the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The dataset used was "New York City Leading Causes of Death" which can be found on the NYC Open Data website. The dataset contains information on the leading causes of death in New York City from 2007 to 2014. This dataset uses information from NYC death certificates to show the cause of death, gender and ethnicity of the people who died. This dataset is important because it shows the diseases and dangerous things that are happening in New York City, and how harmful they are to the people. This website will allow you to see the different sets of data with the amount of people who are killed by a certain thing in a year, as well as the percentages of people who die from each thing compared to others. There is also a way to see the ethnicities of the people who have died, and even cards that show the data similarly to how they shown in the dataset. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In our other two webpages we show/talk about the information we found in the data sets, filter information using cards, pie charts, and many more.</p>
